CSNetwork Services (CSNS)

CSNS is an open-source, web-based software system that combines the functions
of learning management, program assessment, student administration and
advisement into one system; and by doing so, CSNS achieves a level of
efficiency that is not possible by loosely coupling several special-purposed
systems.

Software Requirements

Java and Maven are required to build the code, and PostgreSQL and a Java EE
application server (e.g. Tomcat) are required to run it.

Installation

1. Create two empty databases, one for operational use and one for testing.
2. Populate the operational database using the following two SQL scripts:
  * `src/main/scripts/csns-create.sql` - create all the schema
    elements.
  * `src/main/scripts/csns-test-insert.sql` - create some sample
    data to play with. Please read the script to see what users, departments,
    and classes are created.
3. Copy `build.properties.sample` to `build.properties`.
4. Change the values in `build.properties` according to your environment.
5. Run `mvn package` to build the code.
6. Deploy the WAR file `target/csns2.war` to your application server.
